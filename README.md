# L0newboard

I created a new board with STM32L0K6T6 microcontroller. It has a 32.768 kHz crystal to drive RTC.
An EEPROM connected through SPI. I try to interface with other pheripherals.

First step: LED blinking.
I generate the code with STM32Cube and edit it in OpenSTM32 environment.

Second step: LED is toggled by RTC. Code generated by STM32Cube.


Third step: LED blinking intervall modified. LED is toggled in every 10 seconds by RTC. Cube code modified a little. In Cube AlarmA is switched of, and the AlarmA code was moved to the custom code region.

4. step: Sleep with debug mode:
- 0.16 mA without LED 3.79 mA with LED (board only)
- LED with power IC 4.66 mA power only 0.51 mA
- 0.68 mA without LED 4.56 mA with LED (power + board)
